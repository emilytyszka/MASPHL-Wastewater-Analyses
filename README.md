# MASPHL-Wastewater-Analyses

## Overview
Analyses were conducted for the Massachusetts State Public Health Laboratory's SARS-CoV-2 Wastewater Monitoring Laboratory and Sequencing and Bioinformatics Core Division. The laboratories, through the analysis of municipal wastewater from sites across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, estimated viral RNA concentrations (copies/mL) and frequencies of known SARS-CoV-2 variants.

As the Microbiology Division's Research Analyst, I was responsible for cleaning, visualizing, and analyzing laboratory output, as well as for communicating results to MASPHL and MassDPH personnel. This work hoped to lay the groundwork for future monitoring of viral diseases of public health importance through municipal wastewater.

## Major Projects
- _Interlaboratory Comparisons for Validation_: Samples from MA wastewater sites were split between laboratories and analyzed separately in order to validate SARS-CoV-2 viral concentration analysis methods. 
  - _Virginia_ - MASPHL results were compared to those of the same samples shipped to Virginia's state laboratory.
  - _Biobot_ - Later validation analyses were compared with Biobot, a CDC contracted company that analyzes SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater nationwide, including in MA. 
- _Variant Frequency Analyses_: Analysis by MASPHL's Sequencing and Bioinformatics core provided estimated SARS-CoV-2 variant frequencies in the wastewater samples. Merging of these data with sample collection and concentration data enabled for a temporal analysis of changing variant frequencies and concentrations over the period sampled. I experimented with methods of identifying and highlighting variants exhibiting frequency and concentration increases of potential interest.
- _Comparison of Wastewater Data to Statewide Hospitalizations_ - Analyzed publicly-available statewide daily counts of new hospitalizations to 7-day rolling averages of wastewater concentration using Spearman correlations, as well as a cross-correlation analysis using the `ccf()` function.
